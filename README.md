This repo demonstrates a subtle issue in React Router Dom v6 where a wildcard route (`/*`) can unexpectedly override other routes, even if they are defined earlier.  The provided solution shows how to correctly structure routes to avoid this behavior.  The issue occurs when there is a nested route structure and a wildcard route is included. The wildcard route will block other routes and cause unexpected behavior. This repo includes two components to show the original buggy behavior and the solved version.
